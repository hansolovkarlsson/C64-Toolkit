/*
 * codegen_runtime.c - the fixed 6502 runtime library that every
 * compiled program links against, plus the machinery for string
 * literals.
 *
 * ===================================================================
 * WHY A RUNTIME LIBRARY AT ALL
 * ===================================================================
 * The 6502 has no multiply, divide, or 16-bit compare instructions -
 * only 8-bit add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow. Since cc64's
 * `int` is 16 bits, almost every arithmetic and comparison operator
 * needs more than one or two instructions to implement correctly, and
 * several (multiply, divide, signed comparison) need a genuine
 * multi-instruction algorithm. Rather than inline that algorithm every
 * time the user writes `a * b` in their program, cc64 emits each
 * algorithm ONCE, as a callable subroutine (e.g. __rt_mul16), and
 * every `*` operator anywhere in the user's program just does
 * `JSR __rt_mul16`. This is exactly what a real compiler's runtime
 * library does, just at a much smaller scale.
 *
 * emit_zp_equates() and emit_runtime() are called once per compiled
 * program, early, before any user code is generated (see main.c) -
 * every routine defined here is unconditionally included whether the
 * user's program uses it or not. A production compiler would only
 * link in the routines actually used (this is "dead code elimination"
 * or, applied to a whole library, roughly what a linker's garbage
 * collection does); cc64 skips that for simplicity, at the cost of a
 * little unused code in small programs.
 *
 * ===================================================================
 * THE CALLING CONVENTION THESE ROUTINES SHARE
 * ===================================================================
 * Every routine below reads its input from, and writes its result
 * into, one of the fixed "registers" __zpR / __zpR2 (see cc64.h's
 * architecture note, and the zero-page layout comment inside
 * emit_zp_equates() below) - never via a parameter passed on a stack.
 * The convention, used consistently everywhere in this compiler, is:
 * __zpR2 holds the LEFT operand, __zpR holds the RIGHT operand, and
 * the result ends up in __zpR. So `JSR __rt_mul16` computes
 * __zpR2 * __zpR and leaves the answer in __zpR - the caller (in
 * codegen_expr.c) is responsible for getting both operands into the
 * right registers first, which is what the push/pop routines below
 * (__rt_push / __rt_pop2) exist to make possible for nested
 * expressions like `a * (b + c)`.
 *
 * ===================================================================
 * WHY ZERO PAGE IS SO CAREFULLY RESTRICTED HERE
 * ===================================================================
 * See the long comment inside emit_zp_equates() below for the full
 * story (it's worth reading - it's a real bug this compiler shipped
 * once, from a wrong assumption about which memory was "free"), but
 * the short version: on a real C64, the operating system (the KERNAL
 * and BASIC ROMs) actively use most of zero page for its own
 * bookkeeping, even while your program is running. Only a handful of
 * zero-page bytes are genuinely unclaimed, and this compiler now uses
 * ONLY those - everything else needed lives in ordinary (non-zero-
 * page) RAM instead, which is always safe since a running program has
 * that memory entirely to itself.

     * restores them after the call returns - which is what makes it
     * safe for a function to call itself (or call another function
     * that calls it back) despite every function's storage living at
     * a single fixed address. __rt_csp is a 16-bit pointer (unlike
     * __rt_spidx above) since a deep call chain can need more than
     * 256 bytes of saved frames; the (zp),Y addressing that requires
     * borrows __zpAP for the duration of each push/pop, which is safe
     * because nothing that needs __zpAP to survive across a function
     * call ever calls one without first parking that address on the

     * cases and gen_call()'s poke() handling in codegen_expr.c, which
     * already had to solve exactly this problem for array/pointer
     * writes whose right-hand side might itself use __zpAP, before
     * recursion existed at all.
     *
     * This routine runs at the end of every per-function "pushframe"
     * routine (see codegen_stmt.c) and checks TWO independent
     * exhaustion risks that deep recursion creates:
     *
     * 1. The call stack itself outgrowing its fixed buffer. Note the
     *    check runs just AFTER the frame bytes were copied, not
     *    before - an overflowing copy therefore spills past the
     *    buffer's end before being caught. That's deliberate, and
     *    safe, because main.c places __rt_cstack as the LAST thing in
     *    the program: the bytes past its end are free RAM that
     *    nothing owns, so a spill there is harmless, and putting the
     *    check after the copy keeps it a single shared routine that
     *    doesn't need to know each function's frame size.
     *
     * 2. The 6502's own hardware stack (page 1, 256 bytes, used for
     *    JSR return addresses) filling up - each recursion level
     *    holds one return address (2 bytes) for the whole depth of
     *    the recursion, so ~100 levels of depth exhausts it no matter
     *    how small the C-level frames are. TSX reads the hardware
     *    stack pointer into X; if it's dropped below a safety margin
     *    (enough headroom for the runtime library's own JSR nesting),
     *    stop before the next JSR silently overwrites page-1 data.
     *
     * Either way, halting loudly with a message beats what would
     * happen otherwise: runaway recursion (a missing or wrong base
     * case) silently corrupting memory, which is a miserable thing
     * to have to debug on a C64. */

 * String literals
 * ===================================================================
 * A string literal like "hello" needs to exist somewhere as actual
 * bytes in the compiled program's memory - it can't just be an
 * immediate value the way a number literal can, since `puts()` needs
 * an address to walk. intern_string() is called once per string
 * literal encountered anywhere in the program (see N_STR in
 * codegen_expr.c's gen_expr_to_R()), and just records its content and
 * invents it a label (__str_0, __str_1, ...); the actual bytes aren't
 * written out until emit_string_literals() runs, once, after all of
 * pass_b() has finished and every string literal in the program is
 * known (see main.c).
 *
 * The bytes are stored EXACTLY as written in the C source (after
 * escape processing - see lexer.c's read_escape()), not pre-converted
 * to PETSCII. That's deliberate: __rt_puts (above) converts each byte
 * to PETSCII at print time, the same way putchar() does, so storing
 * already-converted bytes here would double-convert them. Keeping
 * the stored data in its "natural" form also means a program that
 * builds or copies a string into its own buffer at runtime (see
 * tests/pointers.c's copy_str()) gets exactly the same printed output
 * as printing the original literal directly. */

 * ASCII->PETSCII conversion - these bytes need to stay exactly as
 * they are in the source, for the reasons explained above.
 *
 * The bytes are deliberately CHUNKED across multiple .byte lines (32

 * character error messages were the first strings long enough to
 * trigger it, and the symptom (one message printing partway and then
