# build.sh - compile a .c file straight to a C64 .prg
#
# Usage: ./build.sh source.c [output.prg]
#
# Chains cc64 (C -> assembly) and c64asm (assembly -> .prg) so you don't
# have to invoke them separately. Requires both binaries to be built
# already (`make` builds cc64 from src/*.c; cc -std=c99 -O2 -o c64asm
# c64asm.c builds the assembler), and expects them to be in the same
# directory as this script (or on PATH).
